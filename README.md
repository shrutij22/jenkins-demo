This repo showcases a streamlined Jenkins pipeline that takes your Java code from source to artifact with ease. It:

Compiles your Java program automatically,
Runs the program to verify it works,
Archives the generated JAR file as a build artifact for easy access,
And comes with a handy Python script that effortlessly fetches the latest successful JAR from Jenkins â€” so you always have the freshest build on hand!
With this setup, continuous integration and artifact management become smooth and hassle-free.
